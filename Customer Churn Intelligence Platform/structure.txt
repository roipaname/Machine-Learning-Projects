Project Summary
Enterprise Customer Churn Intelligence Platform

This project implements an end-to-end customer churn prediction and decision intelligence system built on enterprise CRM data. It combines classical machine learning, feature store design, and LLM-based reasoning enhanced with context engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and output regularization to deliver reliable, actionable churn insights for business teams.

System Layers Overview
1. Data Layer (CRM & SQL)

Extracts customer, subscription, billing, usage, and support data from a relational CRM database

Uses SQL joins, aggregations, and temporal windows

Applies missing data strategies and schema validation

Focus: Enterprise data modeling and access patterns

2. Feature Engineering & Feature Store Layer

Builds reusable churn features (engagement decay, support intensity, revenue signals)

Simulates a feature store with:

Versioned feature definitions

Offline (Parquet) and optional online access

Ensures training-serving feature parity

Focus: Production ML foundations

3. Machine Learning Layer

Trains churn prediction models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)

Evaluates using business-aware metrics (recall, precision, expected revenue saved)

Produces calibrated churn probabilities

Focus: Predictive modeling aligned with business impact

4. Context Engineering Layer 🧠

Dynamically assembles only relevant customer context for LLM consumption

Controls:

Feature selection

Token budgets

Time windows

Excludes raw PII and noisy attributes

Context = 
- Top churn-driving features
- Recent customer activity summary
- Support and billing signals


Focus: Making LLM inputs precise, minimal, and reliable

5. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Layer 📚

Retrieves relevant documents to ground LLM responses, such as:

CRM retention policies

Discount eligibility rules

Customer success playbooks

Uses vector search over embedded documents

Injects retrieved snippets into the LLM context

Retrieved Context:
- "Customers inactive >60 days qualify for onboarding outreach"


Focus: Reducing hallucinations and aligning outputs with company policy

6. Prompt Engineering Layer

Uses structured, role-based prompts for churn explanation and recommendations

Maintains versioned prompt templates

Separates:

System instructions

Customer context

Retrieved policy context

Focus: Prompt lifecycle management

7. Output Regularization Layer 🧾

Enforces structured, machine-readable LLM outputs (JSON schemas)

Validates:

Required fields

Allowed actions

Confidence thresholds

Applies post-processing rules and fallbacks

{
  "risk_level": "high",
  "top_factors": ["Low engagement", "High support volume"],
  "recommended_action": "Proactive retention call"
}


Focus: Deterministic, production-safe LLM behavior

8. Hybrid Decision Intelligence Layer

ML model determines churn probability

LLM generates explanations and interventions only when thresholds are met

Business rules override or constrain LLM suggestions

Focus: Safe human-facing AI decisions

9. Reliability, Safety & Governance Layer

PII redaction and input filtering

Prompt and context drift monitoring

Logging of predictions, explanations, and actions

Focus: Enterprise AI reliability and auditability

10. Deployment & API Layer (Optional)

FastAPI endpoints for:

Churn prediction

Churn explanation

Retention recommendations

Designed for CRM or dashboard integration

Focus: Real-world AI system deployment

Key Outcome

This project demonstrates the ability to design enterprise-grade AI systems where:

ML handles prediction

LLMs handle reasoning and communication

Context engineering, RAG, and output regularization ensure reliability

Job Signal:

Strong readiness for AI Engineer / ML Engineer roles, especially in SaaS, FinTech, and data-driven enterprises.
